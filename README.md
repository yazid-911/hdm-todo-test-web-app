## Choices and Decisions
Concerning the choices I made, after connecting the data base with backend application , I've started with implementing the create feature for the API, starting with implementing the TaskRepository which is responsible for interraction with the database, then CreateTaskUseCase contains the business logic for creating a task, then TaskController defines the API endpoint to create a task. In the frontend, task creation and deletion are handled through API calls to the backend using HTTP requests.so after the user write in the text field and hit the button "ajouter une tache" a POST request is sent to the /tasks endpoint with the task data, and the same for delete. i've added also the delete button, the text field to edit the task, and a button "check mark" to validate.

## BreakPoints
It was my first time to code with Nest.Js so i had to take some time to well understand the application code and architecture but since i have an experience in APIs and backend developpement especially in java/spring I overcame the breakpoints encounterd, and also with the help of documentation in "dev community", "stack over flow" and with some help of AI in bug fixing, the issues were resolved and the application is running good. It is also an opportunity for me to learn a new dev environment.
